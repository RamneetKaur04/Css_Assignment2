        <!-- Lyrics of song 'Big Yellow Taxi ' -->
        <p>
            They paved paradise, put up a parking lot<br>
            With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot<br>
            Don't it always seem to go<br>
            That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone<br>
             They paved paradise, put up a parking lot<br>

           They took all the trees put 'em in a tree museum<br>
         And they charged the people a dollar an' a half just to see 'em<br>
          Don't it always seem to go<br>
         That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone<br>
         They paved paradise, put up a parking lot<br>

        Hey farmer, farmer put away that DDT now<br>
       Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees<br>
       Please
       Don't it always seem to go<br>
       That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone<br>
      They paved paradise, put up a parking lot<br>

      Late last night I heard the screen door slam<br>
      And a big yellow taxi took away my old man<br>
      Don't it always seem to go<br>
     That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone<br>
     They paved paradise, put up a parking lot <br>
     I said don't it always seem to go<br>
     That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone<br>
     They paved paradise, put up a parking lot <br>
     They paved paradise, put up a parking lot <br>
     They paved paradise<br>
     Put up a parking lot<br>
            <br>
